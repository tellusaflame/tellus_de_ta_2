## Test Assignment: Vending Machine Program

### Overview

The objective of this assignment is to simulate a vending machine using principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The program should have the capability to interact with customers and merchants differently and keep track of the transactions.

#### Requirements:
- The program should be written in Python using OOP principles.
- The code should be well-structured with classes and functions for different features of the vending machine.
- The code should be commented appropriately for understanding and readability.
- Error handling should be integrated for invalid inputs or failed operations.
- The program should be tested to ensure all features are working as expected.
  
#### Deliverables:
- The final Python script for the vending machine program.
- A brief report documenting your design decisions and any challenges faced during the assignment, and how you overcame them.
- Test cases you used to validate the functionality of your program.
